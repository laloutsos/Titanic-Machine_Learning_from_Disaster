### Key Steps

* **Data Loading & Exploration**
  Load datasets and perform initial inspections.

* **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**
  Handle missing values, create new features, and encode categorical variables.

* **Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning**
  Train a Random Forest classifier and optimize parameters via grid search.

* **Test Data Preprocessing**
  Apply the same transformations to the test set as for training data.

* **Prediction & Submission**
  Generate survival predictions and prepare the submission file.

### Notes

I experimented with various hyperparameters and models, and also tried different approaches to feature engineering. 
In the end, I kept only the process that led me to the best model I was able to build. 
Further in-depth exploration and experimentation will certainly lead to even better results.All detailed code and analysis can be found 
in the accompanying notebook.
